All notable changes are listed here. Versions follow semver once the first release ships.

## Unreleased

### Milestone 1: local player at parity
- `retake` CLI (Go): `open`, `sessions [--json]`, `version`; config file; flags before or after the video.
- Local server implementing `spec/api.md`, compatible with the legacy Python player in both directions. It refuses
  foreign Host headers (DNS rebinding) and foreign Origins on writes.
- Review page ported to Svelte 5 + TypeScript + Bits UI, pixel-identical to the legacy page in idle, toast and
  version-list states.
- New: audio chunks are buffered in IndexedDB until the server confirms them and resent after a reload.
- New: `.m3u8` versions (native HLS, hls.js fallback), served under `/video/<label>/<file>`.
- New: `author` in `session.json`.
- Take format v1 documented, with a JSON Schema every saved take is validated against.
- Tests: Go unit tests (race), page unit tests (vitest), a Playwright end-to-end suite on generated media (46 tests),
  and a legacy parity script. GitHub Actions workflow for all of it.
